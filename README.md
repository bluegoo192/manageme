# manageme

<i>Project for Calhacks 2.0</i>

<p>Manageme is a web-based calendar which learns, predicts, and adapts to your schedule.  More info available on request.</p>

<p>As far as I know, this program is broken.  I'm not actively developing it right now; I only recently added it to Github for
archival purposes.</p>
